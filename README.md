<h1>This is my first step in mastering Ionic Framework.</h1>

To do so, I made a basic webapp which takes two input from user - 1 is the name of a movie or product and 2nd is the rating from 1-5.

<b>There is validation coded with js and the Ionic Framework is extremely responsive and shows native app profile for iOS and Android.</b>
<h2> Try using developer's console while viewing the website and change the devices from drop down to androi , ios and see how the UI changes.</h2>
This is a stepping stone to infuse AngularJS with Ionic Framework and make a complete solution.
